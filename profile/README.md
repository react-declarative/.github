# Just for you known

> The `react-declarative` is not just a form builder. This one is a huge framework with dashboard adaptive cards builder, crud-based List component and more.

However, I am going to publish It free to open source community, but, you should be able to read [the project Storybook](https://react-declarative.github.io/), browse this organisation for sample projects and [read the source code](https://github.com/react-declarative/react-declarative/tree/master/src)

Keep in mind that in time some projects will be outdated and not every feature will be used in there: I am writing this tool for proprietary usage in first. **And, If you want, I am always looking for some great job)**
